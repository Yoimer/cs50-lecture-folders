<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>This course picks up where Harvard College’s <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS50</a> leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Flask, Django, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, students learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By semester’s end, students emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the Internet.</p>

<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>

<p>You are expected to</p>

<ul>
  <li>attend or watch all lectures,</li>
  <li>implement four assigned projects, and</li>
  <li>design and implement a final project.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="grades">Grades</h2>

<p>Your final grade will be based on your performance on the course’s projects, each of which will bear equal weight. Projects will be evaluated along the axes of correctness, design, and style, with each project’s overall score computed as 3 × correctness + 2 × design + 1 × style. Scores are normalized across TFs at term’s end, so mid-semester comparisons among students of scores are not reliable indicators of standing.</p>

<h2 id="app-party">App Party</h2>

<p>From 5:30pm until 7pm on 5/11 will be an end-of-term app party, an opportunity to demo your final project to classmates, staff, and students from other CS50-produced courses. Students are encouraged but not required to travel to campus for the eve. Family and friends are welcome to join.</p>

<h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h2>

<p>This course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as “be reasonable.” The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.</p>

<p>The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on assigned projects is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy’s other constraints. Collaboration on the course’s final project is permitted to the extent prescribed by its specification.</p>

<p>Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from the course’s heads. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly. If the course refers some matter for disciplinary action and the outcome is punitive, the course reserves the right to impose local sanctions on top of that outcome that may include an unsatisfactory or failing grade for work submitted or for the course itself. The course ordinarily recommends exclusion (i.e., required withdrawal) from the course itself.</p>

<p>If you commit some act that is not reasonable but bring it to the attention of the course’s heads within 72 hours, the course may impose local sanctions that may include an unsatisfactory or failing grade for work submitted, but the course will not refer the matter for further disciplinary action except in cases of repeated acts.</p>

<h3 id="reasonable">Reasonable</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Communicating with classmates about projects in English (or some other spoken language).</li>
  <li>Discussing the course’s material with others in order to understand it better.</li>
  <li>Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code at office hours, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.</li>
  <li>Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to projects and that you cite the lines’ origins.</li>
  <li>Sending or showing code that you’ve written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.</li>
  <li>Sharing a few lines of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.</li>
  <li>Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted previously to this course, CS50 AP, or CS50x.</li>
  <li>Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course’s own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to projects.</li>
  <li>Whiteboarding solutions to projects with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.</li>
  <li>Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="not-reasonable">Not Reasonable</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Accessing a solution to some project to (re-)submitting your own.</li>
  <li>Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a project before (re-)submitting your own.</li>
  <li>Decompiling, deobfuscating, or disassembling the staff’s solutions to projects.</li>
  <li>Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course’s own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy’s other constraints.</li>
  <li>Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a project when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.</li>
  <li>Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.</li>
  <li>Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to projects online or elsewhere.</li>
  <li>Splitting an assigned project’s workload with another individual and combining your work.</li>
  <li>Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond the few lines allowed herein.</li>
  <li>Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.</li>
  <li>Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval from the course’s heads.</li>
  <li>Viewing another’s solution to a project and basing your own solution on it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="acknowledgement-and-authorization">Acknowledgement and Authorization</h2>

<p>Harvard plans to record audio, photos, and video of this course’s lectures, labs, sections, office hours, and other events and activities related to the course (the “Recordings”), with the aims of making the content of the course more widely available and contributing to public understanding of innovative learning (the “Projects”). The Recordings, or edited versions of them, may be made available to other Harvard students, to students at other educational institutions, and to the broader public via edX, the Internet, television, theatrical distribution, digital media, or other means. It is also possible that the Recordings may be used to make other derivative works in the future. Students may elect not to appear in photos and video used in the Projects and may still participate fully in the course.</p>

<p>When you submit the course’s first project, you will need to sign online an Acknowledgement and Authorization in the following form:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I understand that, if I do not wish any photos or video of me to be used as part of the Projects, I should so inform the course’s instructor by emailing <a href="mailto:recordings@cs50.harvard.edu">recordings@cs50.harvard.edu</a> within one week of enrolling in the course. In that event, I understand that I should sit in the designated “no-film” zone of the course’s classrooms and should not walk in the field of view of the cameras. I understand that Harvard will take reasonable steps, with my cooperation, to avoid including identifiable images of me in the Projects’ photos and video shot in classrooms and other course locations after I opt out as just described. I understand that I am free to opt out of the Projects’ photos and video in this way, and that doing so will not affect my grade or my ability to participate in course activities.</p>

  <p>Unless I opt out of the Projects’ photos and video as described above and take the steps that will be outlined by the instructor to avoid being filmed, I authorize Harvard and its designees to record and use photos and video of my participation in the course and activities related to the course (the “Recordings”). I understand and agree that the Recordings may include my image, name, and voice. I also understand and agree that, even if I opt out of the Projects’ photos and video, my spoken name and voice may be picked up by microphones outside the “no-film” zone and may be included in the Recordings.</p>

  <p>I understand and agree that Harvard and its designees will have the irrevocable, worldwide right to make, edit, modify, copy, publish, transmit, distribute, sell, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise use and make available its respective Recordings and any other works that may be derived from those Recordings, in any manner or medium now known or later invented, and to authorize others to do so as well. I hereby transfer to Harvard any rights, including copyrights, I may have in the Recordings that Harvard makes. I will remain free to use and disseminate any ideas, remarks, or other material that I may contribute to course discussions.</p>

  <p>I acknowledge and agree that I will not be entitled to any payment, now or in the future, in connection with the Recordings or any works derived from them. This Acknowledgment and Authorization is a binding agreement, and is signed as a document under seal governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Unless you opt out as described in the Acknowledgment and Authorization, you are agreeing, by attending the course, that your participation in the course and related activities may be recorded and used by Harvard in connection with the Projects without further obligation or liability to you, even if you do not sign any authorization.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you have any questions about the above, contact <a href="mailto:recordings@cs50.harvard.edu">recordings@cs50.harvard.edu</a>.</strong></p>
