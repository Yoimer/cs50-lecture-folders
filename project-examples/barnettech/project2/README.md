# Project 2

A chat program to demonstrate the use of flask, JavaScript and Socket.io
for CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Getting Started

Spin up the app by typing in flask run, if restarting the app please
make sure to clear your local storage


## File Listing
1.)  In the static directory you'll find index.css for some css rules
and index.js with all of the JavaScript code for the project
2.)  In the templates directory you'll find index.html the only template
for our one page app.
3.)  Then in the main project2 directory you'll find the application.py
file with all of our python flask coding.  You'll find this readme file,
a requirements file (no extra packages were installed), and a setenv.sh
file for your convenience to set environment variables using
source setenv.sh

## Notes on the basic atari 2600 asteroids ship
This is a basic proof of concept for using Socket.IO for networked
gaming, I'm looking forward to playing around with a
more worked out networked game for the final project as time
will allow.  Each chat user can move the ship using the AWSD keys,
and the ship will then move democratically on everyone's screen.
