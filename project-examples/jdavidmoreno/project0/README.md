## Ronda

Here, in my first project, and following the guidelines I've chosen something close to me to be the center of my task. Ronda is the town where I live since not so much and is a good theme to work on.

So in this web page is centered in my current town. In the **index.html** I decided to use a nav from Bootstrap with some customizations and I made it sticky. I also place an image on top of the page to make it more visually attractive. In the navbar are basically the four html page I've created, and I copy-paste the navbar in everyone of them, so are always accessible.

Then there is a big header with class 'display-2', and as it's too big when seeing the page from a mobile phone I apply @/media queries to it so on small screen it looks good.

Then there is a big table with photos and info about monuments. Also here I applied @/media query because was too big for small screens, so the third column doesn't display in those cases.

Then we have some others hyperlinks and a `list` with more external links. This `ul` use `col-md-4` so they will adapt perfectly to small screens.

**restaurants.html**

Again the same nav, and there are also some images from a nice restaurant in Ronda with a piece of text. These images are contains in `<a>` elements so clicking on them can be seen bigger.

**secret.html**

Another nice place, quite hidden in Ronda and the photo. Content is also responsibe using the Bootstrap grid system.

**tiana.html**

This is other html page about tourist guides. There is a kind of example using also 'container'  and 'row'. The nav is also present.

**static**

Here there are three photos from Internet. Also we have our styles.scss where style is decided and then it's compiled in styles.css. I've apply sass variables, inheritance and nesting techniques besides @/media queries.
