            <p>The New Bridge is, together with the bullring of the Royal Cavalry Order of Ronda, symbol and soul of the city.</p>
            <p>There were two great ideas in order to built this bridge. The first of them was thought in 1735, being king Philip V, consisting of a 35 metres diameter arch, and whose works finished only 8 months later. Unfortunately, this bridge did not work, because it collapsed, bringing to death more or less to 50 people.</p>
            <p>Few years later the building of a new bridge was begun, in 1751, and it was finished in 1793, at the same time of the celebration of the Royal May Fair of Ronda. The building took more than 40 years, being the executive chief the architect José Martín de Aldehuela, born in the Teruel's province village of Manzanera.</p>

            <p>According to the archaeological studies developed at the region, the church of the Virgin Mary of the Incarnation was located near the rests of a paleochristian basilica from the 5th century A.D. Some historians also date the church at the age of the Roman Empire, having at that time the function of temple. This late suposition has still not been proved by archeological rests.</p>
            <p>At the same place was built later, at the Arab domination age, the main mosque of the Medina. From that age there is only left nowadays the arch of Mirhab and part of its wall, with vegetal arab plaster decoration, hidden just because it is located behind the retable of the tabernacle's altar.</p>

            <p>The palace of Mondragon, also known as Palace of the Marquis of Villasierra, is a wonderful building regarding its architectonical aspects, and, without any kind of doubts, is the most significant civil monument of Ronda.</p>
            <p>The legend tells that it was formerly home of the great king Abbel Malik or Abomelic, son of the Morocco's sultan Abul Asan. Few years later after the death of Abomelic, the kingdom of Ronda was dependent on the kingdom of Granada, and it is also known that the last arab governor Hamet el Zegrí lived also at this palace.</p>

            <p>The location of Ronda at the top of a rocky hill has given the city, among its history, a strong strategic as well as defensive value. The Medina was located here at the Arab age, with well defined city limits drawn on one side, by the natural border given by gorge made on the mountains by the Guadalevin river and, on the other side, by the city walls themselves.</p>

            <p>Ronda's bullring, due to its history and architecture, to its character and beauty, is recognized as one of the oldest of Spain, and also as one the most monumental existing bullrings.</p>
            <p>Not by chance, Ronda is considered as one of the modern bullfighting's art bornplaces. This art was born in the 18th century , in a city where the Cavalry was alive and very popular, due to the existance of one corporation, whose main activity was to avoid the disappearance of the equestrian art. The defense needs of the territory aimed king Philip II to found at 1572 the Real Maestranza de Caballería de Ronda (Royal Cavalry Order of Ronda), for the maintainance at a good shape the use of horses. In order to achieve this royal need, this Organization reserved one city space in for equestrian exercices, and, among them, as traditional in Spain, were the games of hability against bulls.</p>
